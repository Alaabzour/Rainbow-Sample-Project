## Usage
---

1. Import the Rainbow module in your UIApplicationDelegate subclass:

```objective-c
#import <Rainbow/Rainbow.h>
```

2. Set your username and your password

```objective-c
[[ServicesManager sharedInstance].loginManager setUsername:@"myRainbowUser@domain.com" andPassword:@"MyPassword"];
```

3. Monitor login manager notifications

```objective-c
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(didLogin:) name:kLoginManagerDidLoginSucceeded object:nil];
-(void) didLogin:(NSNotification *) notification {
  NSLog(@"DID LOGIN");
}
```

This will login to Rainbow offical server , if you want to login to Sandbox server you need to change the server as follow,

```objective-c

 [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(didLogin:) name:kLoginManagerDidLoginSucceeded object:nil];
    
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:kChangeServerURLNotification object:@{ @"serverURL": @"you sandbox url"}];
    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(0.5 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].loginManager connect];
        
    });
    
```

```objective-c
-(void) didLogin:(NSNotification *) notification {
  NSLog(@"DID LOGIN");
}
```


That's all! Your application should be connected to Rainbow, congratulation!


## Events
---

### Listen to events

Once you have called the `connect()` method, you will begin receiving events from the SDK. If you want to catch them, you have simply to add the following lines to your code:

```objective-c
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(didLogin:) name:kLoginManagerDidLoginSucceeded object:nil];

[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(didFailedToLogin:) name:kLoginManagerDidFailedToAuthenticate object:nil];

```

```objective-c
-(void) didLogin:(NSNotification *) notification {
 // do something when the SDK is ready to be used
  NSLog(@"DID LOGIN");
}
```

```objective-c
-(void) didFailedToLogin:(NSNotification *) notification {
  NSLog(@"DID FAILED TO LOGIN");
}
```

## Instant Messaging
---

### Listen to incoming messages and answer to them

Listening to instant messages that come from other users is very easy. You just have to use the `events` public property and to subscribe to the `rainbow_onmessagereceived` event:

```js

...
rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onmessagereceived', function(message) {
    // test if the message comes from a bubble of from a conversation with one participant
    if(message.type == "groupchat") {
        // Send the answer to the bubble
        messageSent = rainbowSDK.im.sendMessageToBubbleJid('The message answer', message.fromBubbleJid);
    }
    else {
        // send the answer to the user directly otherwise
        messageSent = rainbowSDK.im.sendMessageToJid('The message answer', message.fromJid);
    }
});

```

### Managing additionnal content

You can add extra content when sending a message to a user:

- Define the language of the message

- Define an additionnal text format

- Define a subject

Modify your code like in the following to add extra content:


```js

...
// Send a message in English to a user with a markdown format and a subject
messageSent = rainbowSDK.im.sendMessageToJid('A message', user.jid, "en", {"type": "text/markdown", "message": "**A message**"}, "My Title");

// Send a message in English to a bubble with a markdown format and a subject
messageSent = rainbowSDK.im.sendMessageToBubbleJid('A message for a bubble', bubble.jid, "en", {"type": "text/markdown", "message": "**A message** for a _bubble_"}, "My â€¡Title");

```


### Manually send a 'read' receipt

By default or if the `sendReadReceipt` property is not set, the 'read' receipt is sent automatically to the sender when the message is received so than the sender knows that the message as been read.

If you want to send it manually  when you want, you have to set this parameter to false and use the method `markMessageAsRead()`

```js

...
rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onmessagereceived', function(message) {
    // do something with the message received 
    ...
    // send manually a 'read' receipt to the sender
    rainbowSDK.im.markMessageAsRead(message);
});

```

Notice: You not have to send receipt for message having the property `isEvent` equals to true. This is specific Bubble messages indicating that someone entered the bubble or juste leaved it.



### Listen to receipts

Receipts allow to know if the message has been successfully delivered to your recipient. Use the ID of your originated message to be able to link with the receipt received.

When the server receives the message you just sent, a receipt is sent to you:

```js

...
rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onmessageserverreceiptreceived', function(receipt) {
    // do something when the message has been received by the Rainbow server
    ...
});

```

Then, when the recipient receives the message, the following receipt is sent to you:

```js

...
rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onmessagereceiptreceived', function(receipt) {
    // do something when the message has been received by the recipient
    ...
});

```

Finally, when the recipient read the message, the following receipt is sent to you:

```js

...
rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onmessagereceiptreadreceived', function(receipt) {
    // do something when the message has been read by the recipient
    ...
});

```


## Contacts
---

### Retrieve the list of contacts

Once connected, you can retrieve the list of your contact as follow,

```objective-c
 [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].contactsManagerService requestAddressBookAccess];
    
 [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(didAddContact:) name:kContactsManagerServiceDidAddContact object:nil];
 
```

```objective-c
-(void) didAddContact:(NSNotification *) notification {
 
    Contact *contact = (Contact *)notification.object;
    // add contact object to your contactsArray 
    
}

```

**Note**: `requestAddressBookAccess`  will add your local contact to your contact list, so you can invite them to use Rainbow.

### Retrieve a contact information

Accessing individually an existing contact can be done using the API `fetchRemoteContactDetail:`

```objective-c
  [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].contactsManagerService fetchRemoteContactDetail:_aContact];
    
  [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(didGetInfo:) name:kContactsManagerServiceDidUpdateContact object:nil];

```

```objective-c
-(void) didGetInfo:(NSNotification *) notification {
     Contact *contact = (Contact *)[notification.object objectForKey:@"contact"];  
}
```

### Listen to contact presence change

When the presence of a contact changes, the following event is fired:

```objective-c
  [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(didUpdadeContact:) name: kContactsManagerServiceDidUpdateContact object:nil];
  
```
```objective-c
-(void) didUpdadeContact:(NSNotification *) notification {
    
    Contact *contact = (Contact *)[notification.object objectForKey:@"contact"];
    // check property **presence**
}

```

The presence and status of a Rainbow user can take several values as described in the following table:

| Presence | Status | Meaning |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| **`ContactPresenceAvailable`** | | The contact is connected to Rainbow through a desktop application and is available |
| **`ContactPresenceAvailable`** | **mobile** | The contact is connected to Rainbow through a mobile application and is available |
| *`ContactPresenceAway`** | | The contact is connected to Rainbow but hasn't have any activity for several minutes |
| **`ContactPresenceDoNotDisturb`** | | The contact is connected to Rainbow and doesn't want to be disturbed at this time |
| **`ContactPresenceBusy`** | **presentation** | The contact is connected to Rainbow and uses an application in full screen (presentation mode) |
| **`ContactPresenceBusy`** | **phone** | The contact is connected to Rainbow and currently engaged in an audio call (PBX) |
| **`ContactPresenceBusy`** | **audio** | The contact is connected to Rainbow and currently engaged in an audio call (WebRTC) |
| **`ContactPresenceBusy`** | **video** | The contact is connected to Rainbow and currently engaged in a video call (WebRTC) |
| **`ContactPresenceBusy`** | **sharing** | The contact is connected to Rainbow and currently engaged in a screen sharing presentation (WebRTC) |
| **`ContactPresenceInvisible`** | | The contact is not connected to Rainbow |
| **`ContactPresenceUnavailable`** | | The presence of the Rainbow user is not known (not shared with the connected user) |

Notice: With this SDK version, if the contact uses several devices at the same time, only the latest presence information is taken into account.

## Presence

### Change presence manually

The SDK for iOS allows to change the presence of the connected user by calling the following api:

```objective-c

  [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].contactsManagerService changeMyPresence:[Presence presenceAvailable]];

```

The following Methods are supported:

| Presence constant | value | Meaning |
|------------------ | ----- | ------- |
| **`presenceAvailable`** | "online" | The connected user is seen as **available** |
| **`presenceDoNotDistrub`** | "dnd" | The connected user is seen as **do not disturb** |
| **`presenceAway`** | "away" | The connected user is seen as **away** |
| **`presenceExtendedAway`** | "invisible" | The connected user is connected but **seen as offline** |



## Serviceability
---

### Stopping the SDK

At any time, you can stop the connection to Rainbow by calling the API `stop()`. This will stop all services. The only way to reconnect is to call the API `disconnect` again.

```objective-c


```
